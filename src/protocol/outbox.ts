/**
 * Reliable delivery of a turn's stream frames (PROTOCOL.md, "Short drops").
 *
 * Against a server that announces it (`welcome.config.reconnect_grace_seconds`),
 * every `stream` frame of a turn carries `seq`, from 1 per request id, and is
 * kept here until the server's cumulative `stream_ack` covers it. A frame
 * written while the connection is down simply waits; after a reconnect the
 * bridge lists its turns in `hello.running_turns` and, once welcomed, writes
 * every kept frame again in order. The server stores a frame only when its seq
 * is exactly one more than the last it stored, so writing one twice is safe.
 *
 * Pure bookkeeping: no socket, no timers. The bridge decides when to write.
 *
 * Bounded (see OutboxLimits): the server picks the grace period, up to an
 * hour, and a chatty turn kept that long would otherwise grow without limit.
 * A frame that would go over a bound is not kept, and the bridge stops that
 * turn and reports it as lost rather than let the process run out of memory.
 * A turn's final frame (`done` / `error`) is always kept: it is one frame
 * (at most 900 KB), and refusing it would turn a finished answer into a lost one.
