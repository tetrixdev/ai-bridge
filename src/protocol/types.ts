/**
 * How much the local CLI environment is allowed to influence behaviour.
 *
 * - `isolated` (default): the bridge isolates the spawned CLI from local
 *   influence. Concretely:
 *     • Built-in shell / edit / web tools are blocked (no `bypassPermissions`,
 *       no `danger-full-access`, no `--yolo`). The model can reach
 *       server-declared tools only, via the bridge's MCP server.
 *     • Other MCP servers configured on the operator's machine are ignored
 *       (`--strict-mcp-config` for Claude; per-CLI equivalents where
 *       available).
 *     • `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `GEMINI.md` auto-discovery is suppressed
 *       (`cwd` is already pinned to an empty temp dir by the bridge; Claude
 *       additionally runs with `--bare` so hooks, auto-memory, keychain
 *       reads, and the user-level `CLAUDE.md` are also off).
 *     • The system prompt is the server's; with none, the CLI keeps its own
 *       default (the bridge writes no system prompt of its own).
 *   This is the right posture when the bridge is reachable by end users.
 *
 * - `native`: the legacy posture, kept as an operator opt-in for the
 *   developer-runs-bridge-against-own-machine case. The MCP server is still
 *   registered, but the CLI runs with its bypass flags AND its local
 *   environment (user CLAUDE.md, skills, hooks, configured MCP servers,
 *   plugins, default system prompt) intact. Never the right choice when the
 *   bridge is reachable by untrusted end users.
 *
 * - `workspace`: the posture that makes a real coding task possible without
 *   handing over the operator's whole environment. The CLI works inside the
 *   server-named `working_dir` with its built-in file and shell tools
 *   ENABLED, while the operator's own MCP servers, hooks, plugins, skills and
 *   user-level instruction files stay out (`--strict-mcp-config` and friends
 *   are kept exactly as in `isolated`), and the system prompt is handled as
 *   in every mode: the server's, or the CLI's own default.
 *
 *   This is NOT a sandbox, and the README says so in as many words: once the
 *   CLI has a shell, `cd ..` and `~/.ssh` are one command away. What bounds it
 *   is that `--allow-dir` is opt-in and empty by default, so a bridge started
 *   without it cannot be pointed anywhere at all.
 *
 * Layer B (HOME / CODEX_HOME / GEMINI_HOME redirection with auth symlinks)
 * would further close `isolated`'s residual user-level leakage for Codex and
 * Gemini — see `tasks/open/cli-isolation-layer-b.md`.
