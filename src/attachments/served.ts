/**
 * Files this machine will hand back to the server, and the only way it will.
 *
 * The rule is the whole design: the bridge serves a file ONLY if it recorded
 * that file itself — one it received into `file-uploads/`, or one the
 * assistant handed back — and it finds it by an id it minted, never by a path
 * the server sends. A server can name an id; it cannot name a file. So a
 * compromised server that asks for `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` has nothing to ask with.
 *
 * (The older `attachment_read` frame took a path from the server and resolved
 * it against the working directory. It is refused now; see bridge.ts.)
 *
 * The record is checked again every time it is served: the path must still be
 * a regular file (lstat, so a symlink put there since is refused), opened
 * without following links, the same inode that was checked, and the size that
 * was recorded. A file edited or replaced since it was sent is reported as
 * such rather than served as if it were the one in the chat.
