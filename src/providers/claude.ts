/**
 * Claude CLI Adapter
 *
 * Wraps the Anthropic Claude CLI to produce normalized stream events.
 *
 * CLI invocation:
 *   New session:    claude -p --output-format stream-json --verbose "user message"
 *   Resume session: claude -p --resume <UUID> --output-format stream-json --verbose "user message"
 *   System prompt:  Passed via --system-prompt flag on first message
 *
 * Output format (NDJSON):
 *   {"type":"system","subtype":"init","session_id":"...","model":"..."}
 *   {"type":"stream_event","event":{"type":"content_block_delta","index":0,...}}
 *   {"type":"assistant","message":{"content":[{"type":"text","text":"..."}],...}}
 *   {"type":"result","subtype":"success","session_id":"...","usage":{...},"total_cost_usd":...}
 *
 * Two paths produce blocks, and both run in the same turn:
 *
 *   - `stream_event` frames, when the CLI supports `--include-partial-messages`.
 *     Text arrives in chunks as the model writes it. Mapped by
 *     claude-partial.ts.
 *   - `assistant` frames, which carry a whole message at once. Still the only
 *     form for sub-agent (Task tool) messages, and the only form at all on a
 *     CLI without the flag.
 *
 * A message delivered by the first path ALSO arrives via the second. The
 * duplicate is suppressed by message id — see the `wasStreamed` check below.
 *
 * Helpers (sub-agents) are reported alongside, and both of these are
 * forwarded:
 *
 *   - Each helper frame carries `parent_tool_use_id`, naming the tool call
 *     that spawned it. The whole-message path puts it on the blocks and tool
 *     results it emits, so a consumer can tell a helper's work from the main
 *     assistant's. Absent means the main assistant, as it always did.
 *   - `system` frames `task_started` / `task_progress` / `task_updated` /
 *     `task_notification`, and a `tool_progress` heartbeat every 30 s while a
 *     helper runs, become the `task` stream event. See taskEventFrom().
 *
 * A turn with its input open (`options.accepts_input`, see turn-input.ts) runs
 * the same parser with three differences: the CLI reads NDJSON messages on a
 * stdin that stays open (`--input-format stream-json --replay-user-messages`),
 * its echo of each one becomes `user_input` and the main assistant's state
 * `main_state`; and no `result` ends the turn. stdin is closed by the terminal
 * rule in maybeClose() — main assistant idle, no task running, nothing unread —
 * and `done` follows the process's exit, built from every result.
