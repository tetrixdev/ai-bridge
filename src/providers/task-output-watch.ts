/**
 * Count a background shell task's output as activity for the silence clock.
 *
 * A turn is stopped as silent after `silenceSeconds` in which the CLI writes
 * nothing. A main-assistant background `local_bash` task writes nothing to the
 * stream while it runs — no `task_progress`, no heartbeat; those exist only for
 * sub-agents — so a backgrounded command that is visibly making progress looked
 * exactly like a hung CLI. The terminal rule held the turn open BECAUSE the
 * task was running, and the silence clock then killed it for waiting on that
 * same task (2026-09-29: a release watcher printing a line every 33 s, killed
 * at 900 s with all the work done).
 *
 * So: while such a task runs, poll the file its output goes to, and treat
 * GROWTH as activity. Growth only, never "a task is running": that would let a
 * hung `sleep 99999` hold a turn open until the wall clock. A task whose output
 * stops growing still lets the silence clock run out, and that ends the turn
 * exactly as before.
 *
 * The path is read from the CLI's own reply to the call ("Output is being
 * written to: …"), never built here: the `/tmp/claude-<uid>/…/tasks/` layout
 * is a Claude Code internal. If the reply ever stops saying it, nothing is
 * watched and the turn behaves exactly as it did before this existed.
