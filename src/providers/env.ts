 * would silently absorb whatever happened to be there. Pinning every spawn
 * to a dedicated empty directory closes that leak.
 *
 * The directory lives under `~/.cache/ai-bridge/` rather than `os.tmpdir()`
 * because Gemini's "trusted folders" gate refuses to load project-scope
 * MCP servers from untrusted paths — and `/tmp/...` is never trusted, even
 * with `--skip-trust` (verified empirically: gemini-cli 0.42.0 reads the
 * project `.gemini/settings.json` but skips MCP initialisation when the
 * folder isn't trusted). Most operators already have `~` trusted via the
 * Gemini interactive setup, and trust inherits to subpaths, so a workdir
 * under HOME inherits trust without modifying `~/.gemini/trustedFolders.json`.
 *
 * NOTE: user-level files (e.g. `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`) load regardless of
 * cwd — those are outside the working-directory mechanism and not affected
 * here. Closing that residual leakage requires HOME redirection — see
