   *     auto-load CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md / GEMINI.md from the bridge's own
   *     working tree (see getBridgeWorkingDir()). Adapters pass
   *     `context.workingDir`, which IS that directory unless the server named
   *     one and the operator allowed it — see src/workspace/resolve.ts. The
   *     default stays here so a future adapter that forgets to pass it gets
   *     the safe directory rather than the bridge's own cwd.
   *   - `stdio` keeps stdin closed by default — every CLI hangs if stdin is a
   *     live pipe — unless `stdinInput` is given, in which case stdin is piped,
   *     the input written, and the pipe immediately closed. stdout/stderr stay
   *     piped for streaming.
   *
   * The caller still builds its own `env` (provider-specific quirks like
   * Claude's CLAUDECODE deletion or Codex's conditional PATH belong with the
   * adapter), but routing every spawn through here means no adapter can
   * forget the cwd sandbox.
   *
   * @param command  CLI binary name (e.g. "claude").
   * @param args     CLI arguments.
   * @param env      Fully-built environment for the child process.
   * @param stdinInput  Prompt to write to stdin, when the CLI reads it there.
   * @param cwd      Directory to spawn in. Defaults to the empty scratch dir.
   * @returns The spawned ChildProcess.
