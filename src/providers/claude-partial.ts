/**
 * Claude partial-message stream mapping.
 *
 * With `--include-partial-messages`, the Claude CLI emits a `stream_event`
 * frame per raw Anthropic SSE event, so text arrives in chunks as the model
 * writes it instead of one lump per content block. This maps those frames onto
 * the bridge's existing block model — one `block_start`, many `block_delta`, one
 * `block_stop` — which is what PROTOCOL.md already describes and what every
 * consumer already handles. No protocol change; the deltas just get smaller.
 *
 * Shapes below were captured from Claude Code 2.1.261 rather than assumed, and
 * three of them are traps:
 *
 *  1. The `assistant` frame STILL ARRIVES for a message that was streamed — in
 *     the middle of it, between the last delta and `content_block_stop`.
 *     Handling both paths naively emits every block twice. See `wasStreamed()`.
 *
 *     Note that ONE message can produce SEVERAL such frames — the CLI sends one
 *     per content block, all carrying the same message id — so suppression is a
 *     set membership test, not a one-shot.
 *
 *  2. `content_block_start.index` RESTARTS AT 0 for each message in the turn.
 *     A turn that calls a tool has at least two messages, so the raw index is
 *     not usable as a bridge block index — two different blocks would collide
 *     on index 0 and a consumer keyed on it would splice them together. The
 *     mapper translates each CLI index to a monotonic bridge index.
 *
 *  3. Thinking blocks carry `signature_delta` alongside `thinking_delta`. The
 *     signature is an opaque crypto attestation, not prose, and forwarding it
 *     as content injects a wall of base64 into the user's view of the model's
 *     reasoning.
